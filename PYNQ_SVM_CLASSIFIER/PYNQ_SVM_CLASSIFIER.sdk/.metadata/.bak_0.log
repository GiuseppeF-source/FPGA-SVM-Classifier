If DRE is not included in the AXI CDMA or the data width is 128 or 256 bits, then the address offset of the Destination address must match that of the Source Address register value. Offset is defined as that portion of a system address that is used to designate a byte position within a single data beat width. For example, a 32-bit data bus has four addressable byte positions within a single data beat (0, 1, 2, and 3). The portion of the address that designates these positions is the offset. The number of address bits used for the offset varies with the transfer bus data width.
The software application should only write to this register when the AXI CDMA is idle (CDMASR.IDLE = 1).

This error condition causes the AXI DMA to halt gracefully. The DMACR.RS bit is set to 0, and when the engine has completely shut down, the DMASR.Halted bit is set to 1.      0 - No DMA Internal Errors      1 - DMA Internal Error detected.

Offset is defined as that portion of a system address that is used to designate a byte position within a single data beat width. For example, a 32-bit data bus has four addressable byte positions within a single data beat (0, 1, 2, and 3). The portion of the address that designates these positions is the offset. The number of address bits used for the offset varies with the transfer bus data width.
